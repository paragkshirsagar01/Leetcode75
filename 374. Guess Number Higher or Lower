374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.
You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:
-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
Return the number that I picked.


public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int ans=0;
        int i=1;

        while(i<=n){
            int mid=i+(n-i)/2;
            if(guess(mid)==0){
                return mid;
            }else if(guess(mid)==1){
                i=mid+1;
            }else if(guess(mid)==-1){
                n=mid-1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
